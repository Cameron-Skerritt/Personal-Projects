# Port Scanner
Small project I made, I always wanted to create a "nmap" like scanner which purely focused on finding common open ports for CTFs.

# Hash Brute Forcing
This brute forces sha256 hashes. I want to adapt this so it can detect & brute force multiple common hashes.

# SSH Brute Force 
This script brute forces SSH with a IP + username and a unknown password. You pass a wordlist for the password.
This is a slow process and I want to add threading so it quickens the process.
